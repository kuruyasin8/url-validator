# url-validator

The URL Validator is designed to verify the authenticity of signed URL strings.
It takes the base64-encoded policy and signature strings, along with the public key, to validate the integrity and correctness of the signed URL.
The Validator function ensures that the URL has not been tampered with and matches the original policy, offering a secure method to verify the validity of signed URLs.
